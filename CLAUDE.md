- Write code following YAAGNI principles. Only add code that is necessary for the current requirements. Avoid adding features or functionality that may be needed in the future but are not currently required. Focus on delivering a simple and functional solution that meets the immediate needs of the project.

- Code should be clean, well-structured, and easy to understand. Use meaningful variable and function names, and include comments where necessary to explain complex logic or decisions. Avoid unnecessary complexity and strive for simplicity in your code design.

- Functions should be small and focused on a single task. Each function should have a clear purpose.

- Avoid code duplication by creating reusable functions or modules. If you find yourself writing the same code multiple times, consider refactoring it into a separate function or module that can be called from different parts of the codebase.

- Write code that is easy to test. This includes writing functions that are pure (i.e., they do not have side effects) and can be easily mocked or stubbed in tests. Avoid writing code that is tightly coupled to specific implementations or external dependencies, as this can make testing more difficult.

- Catch errors immediately and handle exceptions properly.
